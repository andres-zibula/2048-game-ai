# 2048 Game AI

![](https://github.com/andres-zibula/project-images/blob/master/2048_game_ai/2048_game_ai.gif)

This is a implementation of an AI for the game 2048, currently it is using a neural network with a genetic algorithm for weight balancing, but since the results of this approach are not very good I am planning to try another approach using minimax or Q-learning

## Requirements

The following libraries are required:

- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [PyEvolve](https://github.com/perone/Pyevolve)
- [PyBrain](https://github.com/pybrain/pybrain)
